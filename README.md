**Hyperparameter Tuning for a Convolutional Neural Network on Fashion-MNIST**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code snippet demonstrates the process of hyperparameter tuning for a convolutional neural network (CNN) applied to the Fashion-MNIST dataset. By systematically exploring different combinations of hyperparameters, we aim to optimize the model's performance in classifying images of clothing items.

**Key Steps:**

1.  **Data Preparation:**

    -   The Fashion-MNIST dataset is loaded, divided into training and testing sets, and preprocessed for compatibility with the CNN architecture.
2.  **Hyperparameter Tuning Function:**

    -   A function is defined to create CNN models with varying hyperparameters, including filter sizes, kernel sizes, activation functions, and learning rates.
3.  **Random Search Tuner:**

    -   A random search tuner is configured to explore a wide range of hyperparameter combinations. The objective is to maximize validation accuracy.
4.  **Hyperparameter Search:**

    -   The tuner iteratively trains multiple CNN models with different hyperparameter settings, evaluating their performance on a validation set.
5.  **Best Model Selection:**

    -   The model with the highest validation accuracy is selected as the best candidate.
6.  **Model Summary:**

    -   The architecture of the best model is printed, providing insights into its structure and complexity.
7.  **Model Fine-Tuning:**

    -   The selected model is further trained on the entire training set to enhance its generalization capabilities.
